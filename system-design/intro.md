## verticle scaling
- optimise process and increase throughput using the same resource.
- eg. optimise the chef, pay him more so that pizza orders are handled efficiently with hard work

## preprocessing & cron jobs
- preparing before hand during non-peak hours
- eg. pizza bases cab be prepared beforehad at 5 am in the morning, when the orders are very low.

## backups (master slave architecture)
- keep backups and avoid single point failures
- eg. keep backup chef and pay him only when the master chef is not available

## horizontal scaling
- hire more resources

## microservices architecture
- well defined responsibilities
- eg. maintaining teams of chefs and grouping them in speciality

## distributed system and partitioning
- keeping systems provided commonly to a local area and available for various business locations
- eg. opening multiple restaurants across the city for better order management, locality focused services, backups and order rerouting in case of restaurant unavailability and power outages or failures

## fault tolerance
- introduce load balancing to better route the requests

## seperation of concerns
- decoupling the system for seperation of concerns

## logging and metrics

## extensibility

# high level design
- seperation of concerns
- horizontal scaling
- fault tolerance

# low level design
- more code and implementation related design stuff (architecture, design patterns, classes, entities...)
