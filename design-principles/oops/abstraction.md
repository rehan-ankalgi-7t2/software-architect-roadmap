> Showing essential data / details and hiding other information
- users should not worry about the inner detials and working of the class

## Key Components of Abstraction
1. Interface
2. Implementation

### Interface & Implementation
- **Interface:** Refers to the way sections of code communicate with one another, typically done through methods
- **Implementation:** the implementation of these methods (how these are coded) should be hidden
- if classes are entangled, it creates a `Ripple Effect` where one change causes many more changes
- creating interfaces for classes interaction, ensures that each peice can be developed individually

> **Abstraction allows a a program to develop incrementally and prevents it from being entagled and complex**

### Types of Abstraction
1. Data Abstraction
2. Process Abstraction
