# Intro to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Problem with functional programming
- there's a need to bind data related to entities in a single unit, this was solved by `structures`
- a huge problem with structures was that it didn't support binding of functions as methods to the data in the strcutures (functions cannot be used inside structures)
- that where OOPS helps

## Basics
### Classes & Objects
> Class
- user defined data type
- consists of data members and member functions
- class is a template / blueprint of an object

> Object
- represents real life entities
- accessed by creating instances of the class
- memory is allocated to to the entity when an object is initialized

## Basic Principles of OOP
1. Encapsulation ðŸ’Š
2. Abstraction
