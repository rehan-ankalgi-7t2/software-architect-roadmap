# Factory 🏭 `creational`

> **Factory Method** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Problem
Imagine that you’re creating a logistics management application. The first version of your app can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the Truck class.

After a while, your app becomes pretty popular. Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate sea logistics into the app.

*Adding a new class to the program isn’t that simple if the rest of the code is already coupled to existing classes.*

Great news, right? But how about the code? At present, most of your code is coupled to the Truck class. Adding Ships into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably need to make all of these changes again.

As a result, you will end up with pretty nasty code, riddled with conditionals that switch the app’s behavior depending on the class of transportation objects.

## Solution
The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method. Don’t worry: the objects are still created via the new operator, but it’s being called from within the factory method. 

Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products.

At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another. However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method.

There’s a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products only if these products have a common base class or interface. Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type declared as this interface.

For example, both Truck and Ship classes should implement the Transport interface, which declares a method called deliver. Each class implements this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. The factory method in the RoadLogistics class returns truck objects, whereas the factory method in the SeaLogistics class returns ships.

The code that uses the factory method (often called the client code) doesn’t see a difference between the actual products returned by various subclasses. The client treats all the products as abstract Transport. The client knows that all transport objects are supposed to have the deliver method, but exactly how it works isn’t important to the client.

## Psuedocode
This example illustrates how the Factory Method can be used for creating cross-platform UI elements without coupling the client code to concrete UI classes.

### Python
```python
from __future__ import annotations
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Creator(ABC):
    """
    The Creator class declares the factory method that is supposed to return an
    object of a Product class. The Creator's subclasses usually provide the
    implementation of this method.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def factory_method(self):
        """
        Note that the Creator may also provide some default implementation of
        the factory method.
        """
        pass

    def some_operation(self) -> str:
        """
        Also note that, despite its name, the Creator's primary responsibility
        is not creating products. Usually, it contains some core business logic
        that relies on Product objects, returned by the factory method.
        Subclasses can indirectly change that business logic by overriding the
        factory method and returning a different type of product from it.
        """

        # Call the factory method to create a Product object.
        product = self.factory_method()

        # Now, use the product.
        result = f"Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with {product.operation()}"

        return result


"""
Concrete Creators override the factory method in order to change the resulting
product's type.
"""


class ConcreteCreator1(Creator):
    """
    Note that the signature of the method still uses the abstract product type,
    even though the concrete product is actually returned from the method. This
    way the Creator can stay independent of concrete product classes.
    """

    def factory_method(self) -> Product:
        return ConcreteProduct1()


class ConcreteCreator2(Creator):
    def factory_method(self) -> Product:
        return ConcreteProduct2()


class Product(ABC):
    """
    The Product interface declares the operations that all concrete products
    must implement.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def operation(self) -> str:
        pass


"""
Concrete Products provide various implementations of the Product interface.
"""


class ConcreteProduct1(Product):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return "{Result of the ConcreteProduct1}"


class ConcreteProduct2(Product):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return "{Result of the ConcreteProduct2}"


def client_code(creator: Creator) -> None:
    """
    The client code works with an instance of a concrete creator, albeit through
    its base interface. As long as the client keeps working with the creator via
    the base interface, you can pass it any creator's subclass.
    """

    print(f"Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works.\n"
          f"{creator.some_operation()}", end="")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator1.")
    client_code(ConcreteCreator1())
    print("\n")

    print("App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator2.")
    client_code(ConcreteCreator2())

# Output

App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator1.
Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works.
Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with {Result of the ConcreteProduct1}

App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator2.
Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works.
Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with {Result of the ConcreteProduct2}
```

## Applicability

-  Use the Factory Method when you don’t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.

-  Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.

-  Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.

### Cons
- The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern. The best case scenario is when you’re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.

## Relation with other patterns
Many designs start by using Factory Method (less complicated and more customizable via subclasses) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, but more complicated).

Abstract Factory classes are often based on a set of Factory Methods, but you can also use Prototype to compose the methods on these classes.

You can use Factory Method along with Iterator to let collection subclasses return different types of iterators that are compatible with the collections.

Prototype isn’t based on inheritance, so it doesn’t have its drawbacks. On the other hand, Prototype requires a complicated initialization of the cloned object. Factory Method is based on inheritance but doesn’t require an initialization step.

Factory Method is a specialization of Template Method. At the same time, a Factory Method may serve as a step in a large Template Method.
