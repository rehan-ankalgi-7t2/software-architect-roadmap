Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access in a system. There are various authorization models, including **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**, each with different approaches and use cases.

---

## **Types of Authorization**

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
RBAC is a widely used access control model that grants permissions based on the **roles assigned** to users.

#### **How RBAC Works:**
- Users are assigned **roles** (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee).
- Roles have predefined **permissions** (e.g., "Admin" can delete users, "Employee" can only view data).
- Users **inherit permissions** from their roles.

#### **Example:**
| User  | Role      | Permissions              |
|-------|----------|--------------------------|
| Alice | Admin    | Read, Write, Delete      |
| Bob   | Manager  | Read, Write              |
| Eve   | Employee | Read Only                |

#### **Pros:**
✔ Easy to manage at scale  
✔ Follows the **principle of least privilege**  
✔ Well-structured and widely adopted  

#### **Cons:**
✖ Can become rigid and complex if too many roles exist  
✖ Not flexible for fine-grained control (e.g., a temporary exception for a user)  

---

### 2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
ABAC grants permissions based on **attributes** of the user, resource, action, or environment.
also known as Policy Based Access control and Claims Based Access Control

#### **How ABAC Works:**
- Instead of roles, **attributes** are used to define access.
- Attributes can include **user properties** (e.g., department, security clearance), **resource properties** (e.g., sensitivity level), **environment properties** (e.g., time, location).
- A **policy engine** evaluates the attributes and grants or denies access.

#### **Example Policy:**
> "Allow access if the user’s department is ‘HR’ and the request is made during office hours."

#### **Example:**
| User  | Department | Resource | Environment (Time) | Access |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------------------|--------|
| Alice | HR        | Salary Data | 10 AM | ✅ Allowed |
| Bob   | IT        | Salary Data | 10 AM | ❌ Denied |
| Eve   | HR        | Salary Data | 2 AM  | ❌ Denied |

#### **Pros:**
✔ More **fine-grained control** than RBAC  
✔ Dynamic & **context-aware** (e.g., time, location, security risk)  
✔ Reduces the **role explosion** problem in RBAC  

#### **Cons:**
✖ More **complex to implement** and manage  
✖ Requires a **policy engine** for evaluation

### 3. **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**
DAC allows **owners of resources** (files, databases, etc.) to control access.

#### **How DAC Works:**
- Each resource has an **owner** who can grant/restrict access to others.
- Common in operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux file permissions).

#### **Example:**
| File Owner | Resource | Permission Given To | Access |
|------------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| Alice      | `doc.txt` | Bob (Read)          | ✅ Allowed |
| Bob        | `doc.txt` | Eve (None)          | ❌ Denied |

#### **Pros:**
✔ Flexible (owners can set their own permissions)  
✔ Easy to implement in smaller systems  

#### **Cons:**
✖ Risky if owners grant access **without proper security awareness**  
✖ Hard to manage in large organizations  

---

### 4. **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**
MAC is a strict access control model where the system enforces security policies based on security labels.

#### **How MAC Works:**
- Resources and users are classified with **security labels** (e.g., "Top Secret", "Confidential").
- Access is determined by **security policies**, not by resource owners.

#### **Example:**
| User   | Security Level | Resource Classification | Access |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Alice  | Top Secret    | Secret File             | ✅ Allowed |
| Bob    | Confidential  | Secret File             | ❌ Denied |

#### **Pros:**
✔ Strong **security enforcement**  
✔ Prevents **data leakage** in high-security environments  

#### **Cons:**
✖ Rigid and complex to manage  
✖ Requires strict classification of all resources  

---

### 5. **Rule-Based Access Control**
Rule-Based Access Control grants access based on a **set of predefined rules**.

#### **How Rule-Based Access Works:**
- Rules are defined based on **conditions** (e.g., "Allow access only during office hours").
- Often used in **firewalls, network security, and compliance policies**.

#### **Example Rule:**
> "Deny access to all users outside working hours (9 AM - 5 PM)."

#### **Pros:**
✔ Simple and efficient for specific use cases  
✔ Useful for **network and system security policies**  

#### **Cons:**
✖ Not user-specific (applies to all users equally)  
✖ Can be **inflexible** compared to ABAC  

---

### 6. **OAuth 2.0 Authorization**
OAuth 2.0 is an **authorization protocol** used in API-based authentication (e.g., third-party logins).

#### **How OAuth Works:**
1. **User logs in** via a third-party provider (e.g., Google, Facebook).
2. The provider issues an **access token**.
3. The application uses the token to access resources **on behalf of the user**.

#### **Example:**
- You log in to an app using your **Google account**.
- The app requests **read access to your profile**.
- Google grants an **access token** to the app.

#### **Pros:**
✔ Secure and **widely used in API-based authentication**  
✔ Users **don’t have to share passwords** with multiple services  

#### **Cons:**
✖ Complexity in implementation  
✖ Requires proper **token validation** to prevent security issues

## **Comparison of RBAC vs ABAC**
| Feature       | RBAC | ABAC |
|--------------|------|------|
| **Access Control** | Based on roles | Based on attributes |
| **Granularity** | Coarse-grained | Fine-grained |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid | Dynamic |
| **Context-Awareness** | No | Yes |
| **Scalability** | Can suffer from role explosion | Scales well with complex policies |
| **Best For** | Organizations with predefined roles | Dynamic environments needing fine-grained access control |

---

## **Conclusion**
- **RBAC** is simpler and works well for structured organizations.
- **ABAC** is more **dynamic and context-aware**, making it suitable for **modern cloud environments**.
- **DAC and MAC** are used in **file systems and high-security environments**.
- **Rule-Based Access** is useful for **system-level policies**.
- **OAuth 2.0** is common in **API authentication**.

If you are building an enterprise application, **RBAC** is a good starting point. If you need **dynamic access policies**, **ABAC** is the better choice.
