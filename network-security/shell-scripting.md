ðŸ’¡ Terminals, also known as command lines or consoles, allow us to accomplish and automate tasks on a computer without the use of a graphical user interface.

Working within the terminal is common practice for any Backend Developer and there are many commands and utilities that can help you achieve your tasks more efficiently.

The best way to learn these commands is to practice them in your own machine/environment. Specifically, these are related to Linux commands/utilities which are the most prevalent in the market.

To understand these commands, read through the manual pages by usingÂ **`man`**Â command e.g.Â **`man grep`**,Â **`man awk`**Â etc.

After enough exposure and practice to these commands, it will become easier to use these in practice
