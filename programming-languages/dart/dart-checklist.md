Here's a structured Dart roadmap for Flutter development to help you master Dart step by step:


---

Phase 1: Dart Fundamentals

âœ” Variables & Data Types â€“ int, double, String, bool, List, Set, Map
âœ” Operators â€“ Arithmetic, Logical, Comparison, Assignment
âœ” Control Flow â€“ If-else, loops (for, while, do-while), switch-case
âœ” Functions & Parameters â€“ Named parameters, optional parameters, arrow functions
âœ” Exception Handling â€“ Try-catch-finally

ðŸ“Œ Practice: Write a small CLI app that performs basic calculations (addition, subtraction, etc.).


---

Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart

âœ” Classes & Objects â€“ Defining classes, creating objects
âœ” Constructors â€“ Default, named, factory constructors
âœ” Encapsulation â€“ Private variables, getters, and setters
âœ” Inheritance & Polymorphism â€“ Extending classes, method overriding
âœ” Abstract Classes & Interfaces â€“ Implementing interfaces
âœ” Mixins & Extensions â€“ Code reuse without inheritance

ðŸ“Œ Practice: Create a class-based Dart program that simulates a banking system (e.g., User, Account, Deposit, Withdraw).


---

Phase 3: Advanced Dart Concepts

âœ” Collections in Depth â€“ List, Map, Set, Iterators, Higher-order functions
âœ” Null Safety â€“ Nullable & non-nullable types, late keyword, ! operator
âœ” Asynchronous Programming â€“ Futures, async/await, handling multiple futures
âœ” Streams â€“ Stream controllers, handling real-time data
âœ” File Handling & JSON Parsing â€“ Reading & writing files, Dart's dart:convert library

ðŸ“Œ Practice: Build a program that fetches JSON from a file and processes it asynchronously.


---

Phase 4: Dart for Flutter Development

âœ” Dart Null Safety in Flutter â€“ Ensuring robust code with safe types
âœ” Widget Tree & State Management â€“ Stateless vs Stateful widgets
âœ” Dart Functional Programming in Flutter â€“ Higher-order functions, closures
âœ” Dependency Injection & Modular Code â€“ Providers, Riverpod, Bloc

ðŸ“Œ Practice: Start a simple Flutter project, focusing on clean Dart code, null safety, and async operations.


---

Phase 5: Real-World Application Development

âœ” Dart Performance Optimization â€“ Efficient memory usage, lazy initialization
âœ” Debugging & Profiling â€“ Using Dart DevTools for performance monitoring
âœ” Dart in Flutter Plugins â€“ Writing native platform integrations with Dart
âœ” Testing in Dart â€“ Unit testing, widget testing

ðŸ“Œ Final Project: Build a small Flutter app (e.g., a Notes App, Weather App) using all the Dart concepts youâ€™ve learned.
