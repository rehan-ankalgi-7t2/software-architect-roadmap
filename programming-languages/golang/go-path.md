Since you're diving deep into Go for web development, here's a structured learning path covering everything from the basics to advanced topics:

---

### **1. Go Fundamentals**
- Installation and Setup
- Basic Syntax (Variables, Constants, Data Types, Operators)
- Control Structures (if-else, loops, switch-case)
- Functions (parameters, return values, variadic functions)
- Pointers and Memory Management
- Structs, Methods, and Interfaces
- Error Handling (`error` interface, `panic` and `recover`)

---

### **2. Advanced Go Concepts**
- Concurrency (Goroutines, Channels, WaitGroups, Mutex)
- Context Package (Handling timeouts, cancellations)
- File Handling (Read/Write files)
- JSON and XML Parsing (`encoding/json`, `encoding/xml`)
- Reflection (`reflect` package)
- Dependency Management (Go Modules)
- Testing (`testing` package, `httptest` for APIs)
- Logging (`log`, `zap`, `logrus`)

---

### **3. Web Development with Go**
#### **Web Frameworks**
- **Gin** (Most popular, middleware, routing, JWT auth)
- **Fiber** (Fast and Express.js-like)
- **Echo** (Minimalistic and performant)
- **Chi** (Lightweight and composable)

#### **Building REST APIs**
- Creating HTTP Servers (`net/http`)
- Routing with `mux`, Gin, or Fiber
- Request & Response Handling (JSON, URL Parameters, Query Strings)
- Middleware (Auth, Logging, CORS, Rate Limiting)
- Form Validation with `validator` package
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth2, Sessions)

#### **Database Integration**
- SQL Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) with `gorm`
- NoSQL (MongoDB) with `mongo-go-driver`
- Migrations (Using `golang-migrate`)
- Repository Pattern & Dependency Injection

#### **Caching & Message Queues**
- Redis for Caching (Using `go-redis`)
- Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- Background Workers & Job Queues

---

### **4. Production-Ready Go Apps**
- **Deployment Strategies**  
  - Docker & Docker Compose  
  - CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD)  
  - Kubernetes for Orchestration  

- **Monitoring & Logging**  
  - Prometheus & Grafana for Metrics  
  - Log Management (Loki, Fluentd, ELK Stack)  

- **Security Best Practices**  
  - Secure API Endpoints  
  - Input Validation & Sanitization  
  - Environment Variables & Config Management  
  - Rate Limiting & DDOS Protection  

---

### **5. Advanced Topics**
- Microservices Architecture with Go
- gRPC for High-Performance APIs
- WebSockets for Real-Time Apps
- GraphQL APIs with Go
- Building CLI Apps with Cobra
- Serverless with AWS Lambda & Go

---

### **Next Steps**
- Build a full-stack project with a Go backend & React frontend  
- Contribute to open-source Go projects  
- Explore WebAssembly (WASM) with Go
