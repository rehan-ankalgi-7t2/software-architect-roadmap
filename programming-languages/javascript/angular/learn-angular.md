   - **Two-Way Data Binding**: Learn how to bind data between the component class and the template using `[(ngModel)]`.
   - **Event Binding**: Handle events in the component (e.g., click, input).

#### **e. Directives**
   - Learn about **Structural Directives** (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) to modify the DOM.
   - Explore **Attribute Directives** (e.g., `[ngClass]`, `[ngStyle]`) to style and change the behavior of elements.
   - Learn to create custom directives to extend HTML capabilities.

#### **f. Angular Forms**
   - **Template-Driven Forms**: Build forms using Angular's template-driven approach.
   - **Form Validation**: Implement basic validation using required fields and Angular validators.

---

### **2. Intermediate Level**

#### **a. Services and Dependency Injection**
   - Understand services as reusable components for logic, data fetching, and state management.
   - Learn how to create a service and inject it into components.
   - Understand Dependency Injection (DI) and Angular’s hierarchical injector.

#### **b. Routing and Navigation**
   - Learn to configure routes with `RouterModule` to navigate between views.
   - Understand route parameters and child routes.
   - Implement route guards (e.g., `AuthGuard`) to protect routes based on conditions like authentication.

#### **c. RxJS and Observables**
   - Understand **Observables** and their role in handling asynchronous operations.
   - Learn to use **RxJS** operators (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `switchMap`) for transforming data streams.
   - Explore **Subject** and **BehaviorSubject** for managing shared states across components.

#### **d. Reactive Forms**
   - Build forms using **Reactive Forms** for better control over form structure and validation.
   - Implement complex validations and custom validators.
   - Handle nested forms and form arrays for dynamic form creation.

#### **e. Angular Pipes**
   - Learn to use built-in pipes for transforming data (e.g., `| date`, `| currency`, `| json`).
   - Create custom pipes for specialized data transformations.

#### **f. Angular HTTP Client**
   - Use Angular’s **HttpClientModule** to make HTTP requests and handle responses.
   - Implement RESTful operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with back-end APIs.
   - Understand HTTP interceptors for handling authentication, logging, and error handling.

### **3. Advanced Level**

#### **a. Advanced Component Interactions**
   - Learn **Input** and **Output** decorators for parent-child component communication.
   - Understand **ViewChild** and **ContentChild** decorators for DOM and component reference.
   - Explore Angular Content Projection using `ng-content` for flexible component design.

#### **b. State Management (NGRX, Services)**
   - Learn to manage application state using services or more robust libraries like **NgRx** (Redux pattern).
   - Understand store, actions, reducers, and effects in NgRx for a more reactive state management solution.

#### **c. Angular Animations**
   - Use Angular’s animation module to add transitions and animations to your application.
   - Explore triggers, states, and animations to enhance the user experience.

#### **d. Lazy Loading and Optimization**
   - Implement **Lazy Loading** to improve performance by loading modules on demand.
   - Optimize Angular applications for production (AOT compilation, tree-shaking, and bundle optimization).
   - Learn about preloading strategies for loading specific modules early based on user needs.

#### **e. Testing**
   - **Unit Testing**: Test components and services using **Jasmine** and **Karma**.
   - **End-to-End Testing**: Write E2E tests using **Protractor** or **Cypress**.
   - Understand **Mocking** dependencies and using Angular’s testing utilities.

#### **f. Angular Modules and Libraries**
   - Learn about **Shared Modules** for reusable components, directives, and pipes.
   - Use **Core Modules** for singleton services and providers that should be loaded only once.
   - Integrate Angular Material or other UI libraries for a consistent and professional design.

#### **g. Internationalization (i18n)**
   - Use Angular’s built-in i18n tools for creating multilingual applications.
   - Handle localization for different languages and cultures.

### **4. Expert Level**

#### **a. Advanced State Management (NgRx Effects, Selectors)**
   - Use **Selectors** for retrieving specific slices of the state efficiently.
   - Work with **NgRx Effects** to handle side effects, such as asynchronous API calls.

#### **b. Progressive Web App (PWA)**
   - Convert an Angular app into a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** using Angular’s PWA features.
   - Implement service workers, caching, and offline support for enhanced user experience.
