# decorators and generators in Python:

**Decorators**

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify the behavior of functions or classes without directly altering their code. They are implemented using functions that take another function as an argument and return a new function.

**Syntax:**

**Python**

```python
def decorator_function(func):
    def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
        # Perform actions before the original function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Perform actions after the original function
        return result
    return wrapper_function

@decorator_function
def my_function():
    # Function code
    pass
```

**Common Use Cases:**

- **Timing execution:** Measure the time it takes for a function to execute.
- **Caching results:** Avoid redundant calculations by caching function results.
- **Logging:** Log function calls, arguments, and return values.
- **Authentication:** Require authentication before allowing a function to execute.
- **Rate limiting:** Limit the number of times a function can be called within a certain time period.

**Generators**

Generators are a special type of function that returns an iterator. They use the `yield` keyword to pause execution and return a value, allowing them to be resumed later. This is useful for creating iterators that generate values on demand, saving memory and improving performance.

**Syntax:**

```python
def my_generator():
    for i in range(5):
        yield i
```

**Example:**

```python
for num in my_generator():
    print(num)
```

**Key Points:**

- Generators use the `yield` keyword to return values.
- They can be used to create custom iterators for various purposes.
- They are often more memory-efficient than creating a list of all values upfront.

**Common Use Cases:**

- Creating custom iterators for data processing.
- Implementing infinite sequences (e.g., Fibonacci numbers).
- Implementing lazy evaluation for large datasets.

**Additional Notes:**

- Decorators can be chained together to apply multiple modifications to a function.
- Generators can be used with `next()` to retrieve the next value or `send()` to send a value back into the generator.
- Decorators and generators can be combined to create powerful and efficient Python code.
