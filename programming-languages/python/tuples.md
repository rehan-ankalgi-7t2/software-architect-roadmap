> Tuples in Python are immutable sequences of elements, similar to lists but with a key difference: they cannot be modified once created. This makes them ideal for storing data that should not be changed.

**Creating Tuples:**

Tuples are created using parentheses `()`. Elements within a tuple are separated by commas.

**Python**

```python
# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "hello", True)
```

**Accessing Elements:**

You can access elements in a tuple using indexing, similar to lists:

**Python**

```python
first_element = my_tuple[0]  # Output: 1
```

**Slicing Tuples:**

You can extract a portion of a tuple using slicing:

**Python**

```python
sub_tuple = my_tuple[1:3]  # Output: (2, 3)
```

**Immutability:**

Unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified. Attempting to change an element of a tuple will raise a `TypeError`.

**Python**

```python
my_tuple[0] = 4  # This will raise a TypeError
```

**Empty Tuples:**

You can create an empty tuple using `()`:

**Python**

```python
empty_tuple = ()
```

**Single-Element Tuples:**

To create a single-element tuple, you need to include a comma after the element:

**Python**

```python
single_element_tuple = (1,)
```

**Tuple Packing and Unpacking:**

Tuple packing allows you to create a tuple from multiple values:

**Python**

```python
packed_tuple = 1, 2, 3
```

Tuple unpacking allows you to assign the elements of a tuple to variables:

**Python**

```python
a, b, c = packed_tuple
```

**Key Points:**

- Tuples are immutable.
- Tuples are ordered sequences.
- Tuples can contain elements of different data types.
- Tuples are often used for representing fixed collections of data.

**Common Use Cases:**

- Storing coordinates (x, y)
- Returning multiple values from a function
- Creating immutable data structures
- Using tuples as keys in dictionaries

By understanding these concepts, you can effectively use tuples in your Python programs to represent and manipulate data in an efficient and immutable way.
