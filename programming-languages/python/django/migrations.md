> Migrations in Django are a way to manage changes to your database schema over time. They allow you to evolve your database schema as your models change, without losing data.

Here’s a breakdown of how migrations work and how to use them:

### 1. **What Are Migrations?**

- Migrations are files that Django uses to track and apply changes to your database schema, like adding or modifying tables, fields, or indexes.
- They ensure that your database schema matches the models in your code.

### 2. **Creating Migrations**

- After you make changes to your Django models (e.g., adding a new field to a model), you need to create a migration.
- Use the following command to create migrations:
    
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
    
- This command checks your models for changes and creates a new migration file in the `migrations` directory of your app.

### 3. **Applying Migrations**

- Once you have your migration file, you need to apply it to your database to make the schema changes.
- Use the following command to apply the migrations:
    
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
    
- This command applies all pending migrations to your database, updating its schema to match your models.

### 4. **Checking Migration Status**

- You can check which migrations have been applied and which are still pending using:
    
    ```bash
    python manage.py showmigrations
    ```
    
- This lists all migrations for each app, showing which ones have been applied.

### 5. **Rolling Back Migrations**

- If you need to revert a migration, you can roll back by specifying the name of the migration you want to revert to:
    
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate app_name migration_name
    ```
    
- Example:
    
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate myapp 0001_initial
    ```
    
- This will undo any migrations applied after `0001_initial` for the specified app.

### 6. **Important Considerations**

- **Order Matters:** Migrations should be applied in the order they are created, as each one depends on the previous one.
- **Data Loss:** Be cautious when making changes that could lead to data loss, such as removing fields or models.
- **Version Control:** Migration files should be added to version control along with your code so that other developers can apply the same changes to their databases.

### 7. **Common Commands**

- **Create migrations:** `python manage.py makemigrations`
- **Apply migrations:** `python manage.py migrate`
- **Check migration status:** `python manage.py showmigrations`
- **Rollback migration:** `python manage.py migrate app_name migration_name`
- **Create an empty migration:** `python manage.py makemigrations --empty app_name`

Migrations are a powerful feature in Django that make it easier to manage database schema changes over time, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors.

```python
$ python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, polls, sessions
Running migrations:
  Rendering model states... DONE
  Applying polls.0001_initial... OK
```

The [**`migrate`**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-migrate) command takes all the migrations that haven’t been applied (Django tracks which ones are applied using a special table in your database called **`django_migrations`**) and runs them against your database - essentially, synchronizing the changes you made to your models with the schema in the database.

Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time, as you develop your project, without the need to delete your database or tables and make new ones - it specializes in upgrading your database live, without losing data. We’ll cover them in more depth in a later part of the tutorial, but for now, remember the three-step guide to making model changes:

- Change your models (in **`models.py`**).
- Run [**`python manage.py makemigrations`**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-makemigrations) to create migrations for those changes
- Run [**`python manage.py migrate`**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-migrate) to apply those changes to the database.

The reason that there are separate commands to make and apply migrations is because you’ll commit migrations to your version control system and ship them with your app; they not only make your development easier, they’re also usable by other developers and in production.

Read the [django-admin documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/) for full information on what the **`manage.py`** utility can do.
