JDK, JRE, and JVM are the most important parts of the Java programming language. Without these, you can not develop and run java programs on your machine.

1. `JDK`: JDK stands for Java Development Kit. JDK provides an environment to develop and execute the java program. JDK is a kit that includes two things - Development Tools to provide an environment to develop your java programs and JRE to execute your Java programs.

2. `JRE`: JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. JRE provides an environment to only run (not develop) the java programs onto your machine. JRE is only used by the end-users of the system. JRE consists of libraries and other files that JVM uses at runtime.

3. `JVM`: JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, which is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is inbuilt in both. Whatever java program you run using JDK and JRE goes into the JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line.
