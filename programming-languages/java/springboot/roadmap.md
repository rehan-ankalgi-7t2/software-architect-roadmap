CRUD Operations with Spring Boot

Exception Handling with @ControllerAdvice

Validation with @Valid and @NotNull


‚úÖ Spring Boot Features:

Profiles and Environment Variables

Custom Configuration Properties

Logging with SLF4J and Logback


üõ†Ô∏è Practice Projects:

REST API for a Task Management System



---

Phase 4: Database Integration with Hibernate + JPA

Learn Hibernate ORM for effective database management.

‚úÖ Hibernate Basics:

Entity Mapping with @Entity, @Id, @GeneratedValue

Relationship Mapping (@OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToMany)

JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)

CRUD Operations with Hibernate

Lazy vs Eager Loading


‚úÖ JPA Concepts:

@Repository and JpaRepository for CRUD

Named Queries & Criteria API

Transactions with @Transactional


‚úÖ Database Design Concepts:

Database Normalization

Writing Efficient SQL Queries

Indexing and Optimization


üõ†Ô∏è Practice Projects:

E-commerce System with User, Product, and Order Management



---

Phase 5: Advanced Spring Boot Concepts

‚úÖ Spring Boot Security:

Authentication & Authorization

JWT (JSON Web Token) Implementation

Role-based Access Control (RBAC)


‚úÖ Spring Boot Caching:

Caching with Redis

Efficient Cache Management


‚úÖ Spring Boot Scheduling:

@Scheduled for Cron Jobs and Periodic Tasks


‚úÖ Asynchronous Programming:

@Async for Non-blocking Operations


‚úÖ Spring Boot Actuator:

Monitoring Application Health

Custom Metrics and Alerts


üõ†Ô∏è Practice Projects:

Secure REST API with JWT Authentication



---

Phase 6: REST API Best Practices

‚úÖ API Design Principles:

Proper use of HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Meaningful Status Codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)

Pagination and Filtering

Error Handling with Custom Exceptions


‚úÖ API Documentation:

Swagger / SpringDoc OpenAPI for clear documentation


üõ†Ô∏è Practice Projects:

Blog Management System with Role-Based Access



---

Phase 7: Deployment and DevOps

‚úÖ Containerization with Docker:

Writing a Dockerfile for Spring Boot apps

Managing containers with Docker Compose


‚úÖ CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Jenkins
‚úÖ Cloud Deployment:

AWS (ECS, EC2)

DigitalOcean, Heroku, etc.


‚úÖ Logging & Monitoring:

Using Winston, Grafana, or Prometheus for observability


üõ†Ô∏è Practice Projects:

Deploy a Production-Ready Application on AWS ECS



---

Phase 8: Advanced Topics and Optimization

‚úÖ Microservices with Spring Cloud:

Service Discovery (Eureka)

API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)

Distributed Tracing


‚úÖ Message Queues for Event-Driven Systems:

RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous processing


‚úÖ Database Optimization:

Connection Pooling with HikariCP

Database Indexing for improved performance


üõ†Ô∏è Final Project Idea:

Inventory Management System with multiple services for Products, Orders, and Users



---

Recommended Tools for Learning

‚úÖ IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / Eclipse
‚úÖ Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB
‚úÖ API Testing Tools: Postman / Thunder Client
‚úÖ Build Tool: Maven / Gradle
‚úÖ Version Control: Git + GitHub


---

Roadmap Timeline (Suggested Plan)

‚úÖ 1-2 months: Core Java + Web Development
‚úÖ 2-3 months: Spring Boot Basics + Database Integration
‚úÖ 2-3 months: Advanced Features + Deployment
‚úÖ Ongoing: Build Projects + Refine Skills


---

Project Ideas for Portfolio

1. Online Learning Platform (Courses, Users, Payments)


2. Employee Management System


3. Real-time Chat Application (with WebSockets)


4. Food Delivery App (with JWT Authentication & Role-Based Access)


5. Social Media Clone (with Comments, Likes, and Follower System)
