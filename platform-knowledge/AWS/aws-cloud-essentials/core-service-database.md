## Relational Database

### Amazon Aurora âœ¨

> MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatibleÂ **relational database**
Â built in the cloud for the cloud.
> 

- It is compatible with MySQL, so you can run those engines with increased performance on AWS.
- The database supportsÂ **High availability and**Â durability,Â ****andÂ you can run it serverless. This takes care of automatically scaling the resources for you.
- With Aurora, you also can run the database with multi-Regional replicas.
- Performance and availability of commercial-grade databases at 1/10th the cost.

### Amazon RDS

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud with just a few clicks.

</aside>

- You can choose Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) to launch the database in the Multi-AZ configuration if you want to deploy it for high availability (HA).
- The service will launch the primary and standby databases in different Availability Zones and set up synchronous replication of data and failover strategy.
- If the primary database goes down, the standby picks up the traffic.

### Amazon Redshift

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Analyze your data with the fastest and most widely used cloud data warehouse.

</aside>

- Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse service that providesÂ **benefits from columnar storage.**
- With this approach, you canÂ **perform complex queries on**Â yourÂ **data**, helping youÂ **run online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads**.


## Key-value database

### Amazon DynamoDB

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Get a fast, flexible, and serverless NoSQL database for any scale to support key-value and document workloads.

</aside>

- With DynamoDB, you can achieveÂ **single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.**
- It is aÂ **fully managed, serverless, nonrelational database**.
- DynamoDB is a great choice when you're looking forÂ **seamless database scalability**. DynamoDB will automatically scale to meet demand.
- DynamoDB is also an excellent choice for workloads that involve working with databases,Â **flexible schemas**, andÂ **high throughput**Â (with many read/write requests).
