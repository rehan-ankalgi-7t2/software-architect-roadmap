## Amazon VPC

- Amazon VPC is yourÂ **private network**Â **space**Â you create toÂ **launch your resources**Â in the AWS Cloud.
- **More than one VPC**Â can be launched into your AWS accounts.

**A private network that provides logical isolation for your workloads**

- This private network isÂ **logically isolated**Â from other VPC or remote networks; forÂ *example,Â isolating development from testing.*
- You canÂ **control**Â **the traffic**Â that can flow in and out of Amazon VPC and the resources launched within.
- You can also control how toÂ **connect your VPC with other networks.**

**Custom access controls and security settings for your resource**

- You can use different VPCs toÂ **launch different workloads or stages or workloads**Â if you want to benefit from such logical isolation.
- You configure how theÂ **packets travel through the layers of your network**.

### Elastic Load Balancing (EBS)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Amazon Route 53 is a DNS service. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is the load balancing service.

</aside>

Elastic Load Balancing is a web service that improves an application's availability by distributing incoming traffic between two or more EC2 instances. ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets and virtual appliances in one or more Availability Zones (AZs).

It also serves as a single point of contact with your application. As a result, your end users do not need to be aware of how many machines your application is running on or all the details, such as the IP addresses of those machines.
