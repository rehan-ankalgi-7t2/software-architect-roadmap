### Forward proxy
- forword proxy / proxy is a web server that sits between the client and the requested server
- forward proxy shields the client
- it protects user identity and avoids browsing restrictions
- blocks access to a certain content
- **example:** VPN
- simply put, server is not aware of requesting client

### Reverse proxy
- Reverse proxy / proxy is a web server that sits between the client and the requested server
- forward proxy shields the Web servers
- protects from DDos attacks
- blocks access to a certain content
- **example:** VPN
- simply put, client is not aware of which server is reponding

> `NGINX` is a popular choice for reverse proxy
