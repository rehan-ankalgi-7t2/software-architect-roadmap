## Event Streaming
````
(1) the practice of capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams of events;

````
2. storing these event streams durably for later retrieval; manipulating, processing, and reacting to the event streams in real-time as well as retrospectively;

3. and routing the event streams to different destination technologies as needed. 
````

- Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time.
